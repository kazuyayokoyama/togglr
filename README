== What's Togglr?

* ON & OFF *
Sometimes you're very busy in your office -- ON. 
Sometimes you can relax and play with your children at home -- OFF. 
When does the change happen? You toggle between the two status, ON & OFF, without thinking everyday.

* Toggle and Share *
To make clear the ON & OFF in your life, Togglr allows you to share the two status with Twitter. 
Before working in your office, just turn the switch ON. Before sitting on the edge of a couch, just OFF.


== The Purpose

Togglr is just prototyping for learning web-based application.
So it may include some bugs and may not work well.


== The Example

Please visit http://togglr.heroku.com/.
You can try it with your Twitter account.


== How does it work?

This web application is built on top of lots of innovations. 
It's powered by below.
  - Ruby on Rails           http://rubyonrails.org/
  - Heroku                  http://www.heroku.com/
  - Bootstrap, from Twitter http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
  - ios-checkboxes          https://github.com/dnagir/ios-checkboxes
  - Twitter                 http://twitter.com/
They allow us to develop it easily and quickly!


== Development

If you clone it and develop it by yourself,
I recommend you use Heroku as the target server. 
Heroku is very easy to deploy ruby on rails app like this app.
After deploying it to Heroku, you should set some environment variables as below.
Please set your Twitter app's keys.

  $ heroku config:add TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="XXXXXX"
  $ heroku config:add TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="XXXXXX"

If you run it on just local server, you can run the server with environment variables as below.

  $ TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="XXXXXX" TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="XXXXXX" rails s
